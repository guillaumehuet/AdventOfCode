# AdventOfCode
My participation to the https://adventofcode.com/ challenges

The challenges are in their correspondy years and days folders.
The days folder contain an information of the number of stars solved (dd_0 for no star, dd_1 for the first star and dd_2 for both stars)
The files within the days folder are:
- rules.txt : a copy of the rules from the corresponding challenge, can also be accessed at https://adventofcode.com/yyyy/day/dd
- input : a copy of the input given to my session for the specific challenge, note that input are different based on the session and the solution is tied to the input, my solution is most likely different to your solution
- solve.py : a Python script that computes the solution from the input file, the output is only the 2 stars solutions
